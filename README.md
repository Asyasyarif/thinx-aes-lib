[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/8dded023f3d14a69b3c38c9f5fd66a40)](https://www.codacy.com/app/suculent/thinx-aeslib?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=suculent/thinx-aeslib&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

An Arduino/ESP32/ESP8266 library to wrap AES encryption with Base64 support. This project is originally based on [AESLib by kakopappa](https://github.com/kakopappa/arduino-esp8266-aes-lib). Unlike the original project actually works and provides optimized methods that do not require using Arduino's flawed String objects.

# Usage

See example for recent code.
